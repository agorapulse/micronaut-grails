= Micronaut Grails

== Grails 4

=== Installation

[source,indent=0,role="primary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Gradle
----
compile 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-grails:{project-version}'

// for Tomcat deployment replace
// compile 'org.grails:grails-web-boot'
// with
compile 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-grails-web-boot:{project-version}'
----

TIP: If you plan to reuse same library for Micronaut and Grails, you can declare the dependency as  `compileOnly`.

=== Usage

Micronaut Grails library helps to use Micronaut beans in the Grails 4 application or any other Spring application.
The main additional feature is the ability to do more customisation to the Micronaut context such as adding a package for scanning.

Replace the body of the `main` method inside `grails-app/init/.../Application.groovy` with the following code.

[source,groovy]
.Grails 4 Usage
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/grails-app/init/micronaut/grails/example/Application.groovy[lines=20..-1]
----
<1> Your `Application` class must extend `MicronautGrailsAutoConfiguration` class
<2> Use `MicronautGrailsApp` instead of `GrailsApp`
<3> You can set the compatibility mode (see below - defaults to `STRICT`)
<4> You can customize the packages for scanning
<5> You can customize the Micronaut environment

==== Compatibility Modes

The compatibility mode signals what is the level of compatibility with the legacy features mentioned in Grails 3 section.
The default is `STRICT` which means no features are enabled and Grails 4 Micronaut out-of-box integration is used.
If you are migrating from Grails 3 then you should select `LEGACY` and enable `com.agorapulse.micronaut.grails` logging
to `INFO` to see the deprecation details.

|===
|Mode |LEGACY |BRIDGE |STRICT|

|Single Application Context
|No
|Yes
|Yes
|If _No_ then two application contexts are created - one for beans using `@Inject` and another one for beans injected by name.

|Injection by Name
|Yes
|Yes
|No
|If _No_ then the beans require `@Inject` annotation at the injection point, and they can be no longer injected by name.

|Property Translation
|Yes
|No
|No
|If _No_ then Spring beans of type `PropertyTranslatingcustomiser` are ignored prefix replacements no longer work. Otherwise, the customization applies to all beans injected by name (not using `@Inject`).

== Grails 3

=== Installation

[source,indent=0,role="primary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Gradle
----
compileOnly 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-grails:{project-version}'
----

TIP: If you plan to reuse same library for Micronaut and Grails, you can declare the dependency as  `compileOnly`.

=== Usage

Micronaut Grails library helps to use Micronaut beans in the Grails 3 application or any other Spring application.
There are three additional features which cannot be found the official https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/[Spring support for Micronaut]:

1. Ability to modify Micronaut environment (e.g. add packages for scanning)
2. Micronaut beans' names defaults to lower-cased simple name of the class as expected by Grails
3. Ability to reuse existing properties declared by Grails - e.g. `grails.redis.port` can be injected as `@Value('${redis.port}')`

The integration is handled by bean processor which needs to be injected into Spring application context. The easiest
thing is to create Spring configuration placed next to your Micronaut classes. The Spring configuration class will
create `MicronautBeanImporter` which will be later processed by the processor bean:

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-grails/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/grails/GrailsMicronautBeanProcessorSpec.groovy[tags=configuration]
----
<1> Define class as Spring `@Configuration`
<2> Declare method which returns bean processor `@Bean`
<3> The name of the Spring bean defaults to the _property name_ of the class, e.g. `widget`
<4> You can provide a different name
<5> You can qualify using a stereotype (annotation)
<6> You can qualify using the name of the bean which will be the same in the Spring application
<7> You can combine any qualifiers possible to narrow the search to single bean which needs to be available from the Spring application context


WARNING: If more than one bean qualifies the criteria then an exception will be thrown.

Once you have your configuration class ready then you can create `META-INF/spring.factories` descriptor in resources folder
which will automatically load the configuration once the JAR is on classpath.

.META-INF/spring.factories
----
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=com.agorapulse.micronaut.grails.example.GrailsConfig
----

== Integration Tests

If you want to take advantage of additional features provided by `MicronautGrailsApp` such additional package scanning inside integration tests then you need to use a following extension of the standard testing library:

[source,indent=0,role="primary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Gradle
----
compile 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-grails-integration-test:{project-version}'
----

Once the library is on the classpath, use `@MicronautGrailsIntegration` instead of `@Inegration` annotation to achieve the similar result:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/src/test/groovy/micronaut/grails/example/IntegrationSpec.groovy[tags=body]
----

== GORM to Micronaut Data JPA Generator

There is an experimental generator for the JPA entities from GORM domain classes. You can use either from integration test or using Grails Console plugin

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Integration Test Usage
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/src/test/groovy/micronaut/grails/example/GeneratorSpec.groovy[tags=body]
----


[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Grails Console Usage
----
ctx.micronautJpaGenerator.generate(new File('/path/to/generated/sources'))
----

The current generator supports

 * Constraints
 * Column mappings
 * One-to-One, One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships
 * Join Tables
 * Unique and regular indices

Please, let us know if there is any feature missing!

=== Generated Entities Example

For an `User` entity such as this one

[source, groovy]
.GORM Entity
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/grails-app/domain/micronaut/grails/example/User.groovy[tag=body]
----

The following files are generated

[source, groovy]
.Micronaut Data JPA Entity
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/src/test/resources/micronaut/grails/example/GeneratorSpec/User.groovy.txt[]
----

[source, groovy]
.Micronaut Data Repository
----
include::{root-dir}/examples/micronaut-grails-example/src/test/resources/micronaut/grails/example/GeneratorSpec/UserRepository.groovy.txt[]
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Dumping Configuration Properties

The configuration properties inside Grails may behave bit differently than inside Micronaut application. If you are using Grails Console plugin then you can dump all the properties available using the following script

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
def mc = ctx.getBean(com.agorapulse.micronaut.grails.MicronautContextHolder).context
def env = mc.environment
def sources = env.propertySources


for (source in sources) {
    println "$source.name:"
    for (name in source) {
        def value = source.get(name)
        println "  $name (${value?.getClass()}): ${String.valueOf(value)}"
    }
}
